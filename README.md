[Mainly Mobile Communications](https://mainlymobiles.com.au) gatsby site definition.

Currently this repository contains all structure and content for the MMC website.

Built via GitHub actions (upon commit to main), and published to the 'release' branch which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Note, this build tool requires Node v14 to operate correctly.

## Future Development

Several tasks are still to be looked at down the track

- Google Analytics + SEO
- Revised layout
- Integration with some sort of CMS to allow for further pages / easy modification by the MMC team.
